This is the (student maintained) style manual for the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University. It is a work in progress and is intended to be a living document that is updated as required. Feel free to make pull requests and raise issues.

The style manual can be found under the [resources page no the Crawford School website](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/crawford01_cap_anu_edu_au/2018-11/crawfordstyleguide_2018_online.pdf).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Titles get coerced into sentence case. Make sure to go back and format proper nouns.

> [!CAUTION]
> Review papers and books might not get formatted perfectly due to the way many publishers present metadata.
