[Click me](github.com/orectique/crawford-style/blob/master/crawford-style-austGov-authDate.csl) to download the file. Double clicking the downloaded file should open it in Zotero. If it doesn't, open Zotero, go to Preferences, Cite, Styles, and click the + button to add the file.

Alternatively, if you have the Zotero browser extension installed, [clicking me]() will open a raw file in your browser. Zotero will then ask you if you want to istall the style. 

This is the style manual for the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University. It is a work in progress and is intended to be a living document that is updated as required. Feel free to make pull requests and raise issues.

The style manual can be found under the [resources page no the Crawford School website](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/crawford01_cap_anu_edu_au/2018-11/crawfordstyleguide_2018_online.pdf).
